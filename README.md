This config uses the development version of Neovim (10+).

### Neovim in VSCode
 You can use this config from within VSCode by using the [VSCode Neovim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim). After installing the extension, you might need to point the extension at your Neovim path and/or config files, if they aren't in the standard location on your system.

 After that, it should mostly just work. Note that any plugin that relies on a floating terminal (such as Telescope) will NOT work, but VSCode already has a lot of the features that you would be missing from the lack of floating terminal plugins.
